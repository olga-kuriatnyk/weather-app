# Weather App

Build the weather app using JavaScript and React.js hooks, async/await as well as AXIOS and CSS modules.

Learned how to use Hooks in React.js, how to create custom ones, refactored some functions and checked that the code doesn't break depending on the response received from the MetaWeather API.
